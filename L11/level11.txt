XOR operation:
Props:
A ^ (B^C) = (A^B) ^ C
A^B = B^A
A^A = 0
0^A = 0


We have A ^ K = R 
A - initial string (we have - "{\"showpassword\":\"no\",\"bgcolor\":\"#ffffff\"}")
K - unknown key
R - resulted encrypted text ( we have - base64decode("ClVLIh4ASCsCBE8lAxMacFMZV2hdVVotEhhUJQNVAmhSEV4sFxZZaAw=")

We have A ^ K = R

==> 
A ^ (A^K) = A ^ R
(A^A) ^ K = A ^ R
0 ^ K = A ^ R
K = A ^ R 
==> Key = initial string XOR decoded cookie

After we find the key, re-encrypt another string with showpassword=yes, and modify the cookie, we get the next pass:
The password for natas12 is sh7DrWKtb8xw9PIMkh8OQsgno6iZnJQu
